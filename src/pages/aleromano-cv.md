## Summary
I love to help people collaborate better.
I'm addicted to details and obsessed with how things work: from Cloud services to human relationships. Since my first Hello World in RPG Maker, I have come to believe that being an Engineer is much more than coding.
I strongly believe people come before processes and tools and I think great Team Work wins over individual contribution.

## Work Experience

### Senior Engineering Manager & Milan Hub Site Lead
**Mollie, Milan (IT) | 2025/03 - present**

I was promoted to Engineering Leader of the Merchant Monitoring domain. I currently manage two Engineering Managers and still have one team reporting directly to me.
As Milan Hub Site Lead, I handle all operational and bureaucratic topics, aiming to make the Hub an outstanding place to work.

**Main achievements:**
*   We kicked off an experiment to offer cash advances using internal funding instead of relying solely on our third-party provider. The MVP performed so well that we built a dedicated team around it, generating **200k in fee revenue** within six months. Along the way, we also launched our own Probability of Default model.
*   We built a near-real-time monitoring system from scratch, fully integrated with our newly launched Business Account. It lets us review both SEPA transfers and card transactions in **under 100 ms**. The architecture is designed so a Machine Learning model can be plugged in easily in the coming months. This began as a regulatory requirement, and I influenced the decision to build it in-house instead of using existing third-party solutions. We delivered it on time for our go-to-market.
*   We are developing a Dispute Management system with public APIs and a dedicated UI in the Mollie Dashboard. Other domains postponed this project for two years; once assigned to us, we pushed it into full-speed delivery. Public beta is planned for Q1 2026. The goal is to increase dispute win rates for our merchants and potentially generate revenue in the future.
* We are close to launching a multi-agent AI system that automatically evaluates
the majority of our financial crime cases. It is already auto-closing cases where a
separate model calculates a very low probability of being reportable. A sample of
these auto-closed cases is reviewed by our QA team, and results have been
extremely encouraging. The whole system was built during an **innovation week**, a
moment when we deliberately create mental space for teams to explore
unconventional approaches, especially in areas where our existing solutions are
perfectly functional but clearly suboptimal.
* I led the Milan Hub’s growth from **8 to 70+ employees** in a single year, including
opening a new office in downtown Milan.

### Engineering Manager
**Mollie, Milan (IT) | 2023/12 - 2025/03**

I manage three teams in the Merchant Monitoring domain, making sure bad actors stay out of our door.

**Main achievements:**
*   Brought all monitoring and alerting tools for money laundering and terrorism financing in-house, blending deterministic logic with Machine Learning. This saved **130k per year** and let us tailor the monitoring stack to new Mollie products, especially non-payment ones.
*   Delivered a fraud-focused Machine Learning model for onboarding signals. This cut our fraud-related financial losses from **500k per year to 170k** per year.
*   Built an internal Sanctions Screening tool, including a full ETL pipeline connected to public sanctions lists and a fuzzy-matching algorithm. It became a key asset for the Customer Due Diligence team, allowing deep sanctions checks across our entire merchant base in **hours instead of days**.
*   Rolled out a Case Management System for all Operational teams, integrated with our automated decisioning engine. When a human needs to step in, the system centralizes every relevant piece of information, enabling fast, well-informed decisions without relying on external tools. This reduced investigation time for complex financial-crime cases **from weeks to days**.

### Head of Engineering
**Banca AideXa, Milan (IT) | 2020/10 - 2023/12**

I was able to achieve great results thanks to the amazing team I created, led, and managed.

**Together, we accomplished the following:**
*   Released 4 different Lending products (unsecured and with external guarantees) within the first year of Banca AideXa in order to find product-market fit while coping with the pandemic (**closing 2021 with 80 million of loans disbursed and 2.000 unique customers**). In 2022 we built 2 new medium-to-long-term loan products achieving a 3x in unique customers and 4x in loans disbursed.
*   Additionally, we delivered a Bank Deposit Account product.
*   Integrated HubSpot to improve loan application review. The final decision time for secured loans reduced from 3 to 2 weeks (avg).
*   Progressively **insourced the core skills** needed to build our products (2 Tech Leaders, 3 Software Eng, 2 Data Eng, 1 Platform Eng, 1 QA Eng, 1 HubSpot Eng).
*   We shifted to a Team Augmentation model and reviewed our external consultants.
*   Created an End-to-End testing automation platform, achieving 100% coverage on Credit Decision APIs and lowering the CFR to 13%.
*   Setup an Observability Platform for proactive error handling, reducing Bugfixing Cycle Time to 2 days.
*   Defined an API strategy around Domains and Bounded Contexts. It became a new revenue stream by the end of 2023 with a pay-per-usage model.
*   Managed a 3.5 million budget identifying CAPEX/OPEX expenses, focusing on the return on investment.
*   We decreased costs on third-party pay-per-usage by shifting to a forfeit model (plus an aggressive cache policy) resulting in a **17% savings**.
*   Defined Software Engineering guidelines standardizing the Tech Stack, implementing eXtreme Programming techniques, Architecture Decision Records.
*   Regularly involved all the AideXers in monthly Open Forums about Tech topics relevant to the Business, opening the field to GenAI usage.
*   Implemented new policies and processes using automation to stay compliant with banking regulations (monthly checking 3rd parties respecting SLAs).

### Engineering Manager
**lastminute.com, Chiasso (CH) | 2019/04 - 2020/09**

My role is a very unique one. Let's sum it up in a sentence: I help people shine.

**What the team and I achieved together (top 3):**
* Created real-time buying for luggage in post-sale through My lastminute.com area so that no phone calls are required anymore. Sold more than 9k baggage in 2019 with a conversion rate above 13%.
* Migrated 300k customers from weg.de (7pass auth system) to lastminute.com Auth System with 0 downtimes for customers.
* Migrated 830k bookings from weg.de platform (Midoco) to lastminute.com one hiding the SOAP-based system (Midoco) behind a Push System.

**How I lead:**
*   **I'm responsible for the Team's Growth:** I have a strong emotional intelligence which I try to improve every day; this allows me to have very effective 1-1 interactions where I help team members make the right direction for their careers development.
*   **I'm responsible for the technical solutions my team creates:** I try to mentor by using pair programming and doing code reviews. I prefer to help the team make a decision rather than taking one on my own.
*   **I'm responsible for keeping the team committed and efficient as much as possible:** I love to create a good environment where everyone feels safe and able to share their ideas. I'm very honest and open in communication as I believe that sharing is the most effective way to empower ownership. I love to analyze data regarding Team Performance, giving and receiving useful feedback during retrospectives.
*   **I'm responsible for communication:** My job is well done when every member of the team (Product Owner, Copywriter, UX Designer, Eng) knows the E2E vision of the Products we are building. I understand that I cannot excel in all those responsibilities at the same time, so I try to grow team members by delegating part of my tasks: every team should have different Tech Leaders and Scrum Masters.

*Besides my usual work in the team, I'm an active member of &lt;❤ FrontLovers /&gt;, our multi-country Community of Practice regarding FrontEnd topics.*

### Software Engineer
**lastminute.com, Chiasso (CH) | 2017/01 - 2019/04**

Started just as Front-End developer, during my journey in lastminute.com I got acquainted with Back-End and Mobile technologies. Right now, I usually develop end-to-end user stories from the REST service to the front-ends.
In our team we are very committed to deliver value thanks to eXtreme Programming techniques: pair programming enabled us to share knowledge of the domain and the technology.
Typescript helped a lot in destroying the silos of front-end, back-end and mobile developers: we keep specialised in different area, but we tend to improve in every platform.

**The two most notable projects we are facing are:**
*   Progressive migration of an old Backbone-Marionette application to Vanilla + React (using as much Functional Components as possible).
*   Enhancement of an already developed mobile app with sections in React-Native.

On the back-end side we are writing as much Kotlin as possible, enjoying its reduced verbosity and good type-inference.
I usually play the role of the Scrum master and my aim is to make my team as self-organized as possible so it won't even need this role at all!

### Fullstack Developer
**Cornèr Bank via Mac Solutions, Bedano (CH) | 2016/06 - 2016/12**
