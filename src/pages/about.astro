        <p>
            Hi! I'm Alessandro Romano, a passionate software engineer with a love for building elegant solutions to
            complex problems. I specialize in web development and have experience working with modern technologies like
            Astro, Docker, and cloud platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open source projects, or
            tinkering with containerization and deployment strategies to make applications more efficient and scalable.
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and creating user-friendly experiences that make a difference.
            I'm a big fan of Astro and Docker, and I'm always looking for new ways to improve my skills and contribute
            to the community.
        </p>
