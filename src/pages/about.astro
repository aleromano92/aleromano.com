    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        Hi! I'm Alessandro Romano, a passionate software engineer with a love for building elegant solutions to complex
        problems. I specialize in web development and have experience working with modern technologies like Astro,
        Docker, and cloud platforms.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open source projects, or
        tinkering with containerization and deployment strategies to make applications more efficient and scalable.
    </p>
    <p>
        I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and creating user-friendly experiences that make a difference. I'm
        a big fan of Astro and Docker, and I'm always looking for new ways to improve my skills and contribute to the
        community.
    </p>
