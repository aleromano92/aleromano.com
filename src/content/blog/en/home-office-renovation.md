I decided to renovate my Home Office.

The 4 traits I focused on:

1.  increase comfort 💺
2.  improve sound experience 🔊
3.  look better during video calls 💅🏻
4.  reduce distractions ❗

## **This was the starting point.**

A horizontal desk 160x60cm, an external monitor, keyboard and mouse. In this picture, you can see my old Surface 3 (I sold it) and my books and notebooks while studying for my degree.

## **The cons**

-   The chair did not have lumbar support.
-   I could not lay my arms on the desk while typing, because the desk was not large enough: the keyboard was too close to the desk border.
-   The keyboard was an old (but good) apple Keyboard with a Mighty Mouse.
-   🔊 I had no external speakers nor microphone, so my day was always wearing in-ear headphones (a Sony pair which I really love [**amzn.to/3pH7TwQ**](https://amzn.to/3pH7TwQ) ).
-   💅🏻 I did have a lot of shadows and light coming from the left, making me not look good on the webcam.
-   ❗The room was shared with my wife: her desk was on the opposite side of the room. but we had problems when we both attended meetings. Plus, we used that room as a closet so it was a bit messy.

## **Start renovating**

We have a very spacious house (lucky us) so I was able to use part of our basement to create a private Home Office. The room is 3.80 x 2.80 mt and I started sketching a possible furniture disposition.

The most important part I focused on was the desk. I wanted a big corner desk with plenty of room to lay down my arms (45cm from desk border to keyboard) and the right distance to my monitors (60-70cm ready to migrate to a big curved one).

I wanted a library where I can show my Final Fantasy, Kingdom hearts and One Piece collections: manga, video games and action figures so I can turn off any background filter during video calls and anyone can get a glimpse of my passions. 🏯

I wanted to create an atmosphere where the white, wooden and green colors can mix and match to give me a relaxed, bright environment.

So I bought some SPC floor to easily install on top of the existing one: their click mechanism allowed me and my wife to do it on our own.

I looked on different second-hand sites and found my desk, wardrobe and library! There was a lot of fun renting a van with my wife and going to get all of them 🚚

## **New purchases**

First of all, I bought a gaming chair. After countless reviews and going through stores, I found the best for my needs in a GT Player chair: [**amzn.to/34mU53m**](https://amzn.to/34mU53m)

Then, I wanted a portable mechanical keyboard with a numeric pad. I always spied on Keychron and in the end I bought a K4: [**amzn.to/3sWJVQB**](https://amzn.to/3sWJVQB)

I wanted a new mouse too, an ergonomic wireless one like the Anker I bought: [**amzn.to/3vL5nK6**](https://amzn.to/3vL5nK6)

I bought a transparent carpet to put under the chair in order to protect the new floor from the chair wheels: [**amzn.to/3tCu0pC**](https://amzn.to/3tCu0pC)

I already have a desk lamp I use to enlighten my face during video calls, here is the link: [**amzn.to/3vJx7P7**](https://amzn.to/3vJx7P7)

I bought 3 small plants: aloe vera, Ficus Benjamin and Lucky bamboo. They should help keep the air quality good.

Regarding lightning: for offices, it is advised to have 300-400 Lux per square meter. Simple math 400x11 = 4400 Lumen needed. I bought a lamp holder

I chose a warm light as I find it more relaxing.

This is a bit of what the office looks like right now 😁

## **Still missing**

1.  a microphone that makes me sound like a rock star 🧑🏻‍🎤🎙️
2.  external speakers that make my in-ear headphones not needed at all 🎶
3.  a fixed external webcam with higher definition 📸
4.  sound absorbing panels
5.  a big wide curved monitor (I think 1 big monitor may be superior to the 2 monitors setup)
6.  probably, an air conditioner as I think summer may be really hot
7.  a beautiful organizer like [**amzn.to/372JWcV**](https://amzn.to/372JWcV)
8.  some paintings

🚀

DAJE!
