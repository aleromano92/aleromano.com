## **Ok, but... why?**

I'm working forÂ [**AideXa**](https://www.aidexa.it/)Â as Head of IT Development (& Delivery) since October after 4 beautiful years atÂ [**lastminute.com**](https://lastminute.com/). As Software Engineer I was so used to my Macbook Pro that I thought I would never be able to go back. AideXa, as a company acting in a High Regulated Environment, has strong requirements in terms of devices and control over them, that's why we preferred to stick to a Microsoft-driven ecosystem with Azure, Active Directory and the Office suite. This doesn't mean we are not evaluating introducing any Apple notebook in our company policy should they prove superior in particular areas (yeah, M1 CPU I'm talking about you).

### **Windows has changed**

It is crystal clear Microsoft has changed its mind regarding Open Source and providing better experiences for Developers. One of the key features I use the most isÂ **Windows Subsystem for Linux**Â (WSL). They even releasedÂ [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/)Â which is a pearl in the world of Code Editors (with superpowers).

### **Spotlight -> Win key**

This is a quick Win (pun intended) as Windows Search is greatly improved: press down it, type a query and you'll get a smart search across apps, files and settings.

### **Hot Corner to logout -> Win Key + L**

I used to move my cursor in the bottom right corner to securely block my Mac. I now press Win Key + L.

### **Terminal/iTerm -> Windows Terminal**

Another great example of Microsoft embracing open source, releasing its applications and making them suitable for developers.Â [**Windows Terminal, Console and Command line**](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal)Â has all the features I needed: it works well with the oldÂ **cmd**,Â **Power Shell**Â andÂ **bash**Â console you get by installing WSL.

### **Maccy/Clip -> Win Key + V (Clipboard Manager)**

I think the feature I abuse the most. You don't need any external application, it is built-in in any Windows 10 setup. Just hold Win Key + V to get the Clipboard Manager that (once activated) can store almost infinite Entries, including text, images and whatever you were able to . It is a breeze to remove all or just some of them and you can even pin your favorite!

### **Emoji Picker -> Win Key + . (dot)**

While on Mac OS you can press Command + Control + Spacebar to open the emoji picker

On Windows, you can access an even better version (it includes GIF search too) by hitting Win Key + . (dot)
