# 3 Career Tips Nobody Talks About
### For Engineers

Note:
Welcome! Today I'll share three career tips that most engineers never hear about. These insights come from 10+ years in tech and watching what actually gets people promoted.

---

## The Wrong Approach

> "I want to grow as an Individual Contributor, so I decided to study Rust to aim for a promotion"

Note:
This is what I hear constantly. Engineers think learning new languages equals promotion. It doesn't work that way.

## Who Am I?

# The 3 Tips

1. Understand what your company rewards <!-- .element: class="" -->
2. "I'm on it" mentality <!-- .element: class="blur" -->
3. Ask for feedback and give back <!-- .element: class="blur" -->

Note:
Here are the three tips that actually drive promotions. Let's start with tip number one.

---

## Companies Are Different

- Google: Launch new products <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Amazon: Improve existing processes <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Some companies: Just save massive cloud costs <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
Google rewards launching new products - hence the Google graveyard. Amazon focuses on efficiency. Others just want you to optimize their AWS bill.

---

## Career Frameworks Are Just Starting Points

- Often too generic <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Words like "complexity" and "high impact" <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Ask your manager for concrete examples <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
Don't rely on the career framework document. Ask your manager to translate those vague principles into real examples.

---

## Business Impact

### Quantify Everything

- ❌ "I improved performance" <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- ✅ "I reduced response times by 40%, saving €X per year" <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- ❌ "I increased system resilience" <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- ✅ "Incidents decreased from 4/month to 1/quarter" <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
Business impact is universal. But you must quantify it. Numbers make your achievements concrete and memorable.

---

## Glue Work Matters Too

- Mentorship <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Unblocking colleagues <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Cross-team solutions <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Facilitating communication <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

### Document it. Get peer feedback. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
Not everything is quantifiable. Glue work is essential but hard to measure. Document it and get testimonials from people you help.

---

## Help Your Manager Succeed

- Their objectives = your opportunities <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Ask: "What are your main goals this quarter?" <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Actively contribute to their targets <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Build trust by making their job easier <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
Your manager's success directly impacts yours. Understand their goals and actively help them achieve those goals.

# The 3 Tips

1. Understand what your company rewards <!-- .element: class="blur" -->
2. "I'm on it" mentality <!-- .element: class="" -->
3. Ask for feedback and give back <!-- .element: class="blur" -->

Note:
Now let's dive into tip number two - the "I'm on it" mentality.

---

## The Power of "I'm On It"

> Have you seen a senior engineer respond "I'm on it" to an incident?

- Builds reputation for reliability <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Demonstrates proactivity <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Creates serenity and admiration <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Makes people want to help you <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
When someone says "I'm on it" during an incident, everyone feels relief. That person becomes indispensable.

---

## Make Your Work Visible

- Documentation: Decision records, post-mortems, brag journal <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Presentations: Share project results in team meetings <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Async communication: Update on progress regularly <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- 1-on-1s: Don't assume your manager knows everything <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
The best work is useless if nobody knows about it. Make your contributions visible through multiple channels.

---

## Always Keep Your Promises

- When you can't deliver, communicate proactively <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Transparency builds trust <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Silence destroys it <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- "This is complex, let me think and get back to you by Friday" <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
Never let someone discover you're late by asking you. Communicate delays as soon as you know about them.

# The 3 Tips

1. Understand what your company rewards <!-- .element: class="blur" -->
2. "I'm on it" mentality <!-- .element: class="blur" -->
3. Ask for feedback and give back <!-- .element: class="" -->

Note:
Finally, let's explore tip number three - asking for feedback and giving back.

---

## Filter Feedback Wisely

- Ask people you respect <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Who have achieved results you admire <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Don't limit yourself to engineers <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Thank them and explain your action plan <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
Be selective about whose feedback you seek. And remember, giving feedback requires investment from others.

---

## Non-Technical Feedback Is Gold

- Product managers <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Designers <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Customer success <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Marketing and sales <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

### They see your blind spots <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
A PM teaching you storytelling is as valuable as a senior engineer suggesting JVM internals. Different perspectives reveal blind spots.

---

## Be a Mentor

- Teaching solidifies your knowledge <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Builds your reputation <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Creates valuable connections <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Think of your first mentor - be that for someone else <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
Few things accelerate your growth like helping others grow. Think about who turned the corner for you in your career.

---

## External Validation

- Meetups and conferences <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Open source contributions <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Technical writing <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Builds internal credibility <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
External recognition gives you internal credibility and creates a portfolio of your skills.

## One Last Thing

Learning new languages **can** be the right move...

But if you think it is the **only** thing needed.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

**It's not.** <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
Don't misunderstand me - technical skills matter. But they're just one piece of the puzzle, not the whole solution.
