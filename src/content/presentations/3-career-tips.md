## The Rules of the Game

### Understand what your company rewards

- If there's a career framework, it's just a starting point
- Ask your manager for practical examples
- **Evergreen principle**: Business impact matters most
- Quantify everything you do

Note:
This is rule number one: understand what your company actually rewards, not just what they say they reward. Many companies have career frameworks, but these are often just starting points. The real key is to ask your manager for specific examples of people who got promoted recently and what they did. Focus on business impact - this is the evergreen principle that works everywhere. Always try to quantify your achievements with numbers and metrics.

## Help Your Manager Succeed

### Understand how your manager is evaluated

- Their success = your success
- Ask: "What are your main goals this quarter?"
- Proactively solve their problems
- Make their job easier

Note:
This might sound obvious, but many engineers overlook this crucial point. Your manager's success directly correlates with your success. I recommend having a direct conversation: "What are your main goals this quarter?" Then think about how you can contribute to those goals. When you make your manager's job easier, you become indispensable.

## "I'm On It" Mentality

### The Power of Accountability

- Show up consistently
- Take ownership of problems
- Seek more responsibilities before asking for promotion
- Always keep your promises

Note:
Rule number two is developing what I call the "I'm on it" mentality. This is about reliability and accountability. When someone asks you to do something, respond with "I'm on it" and then actually follow through. This builds incredible trust. Seek more responsibilities before asking for promotion - this shows you're ready for the next level.

## Make Your Work Visible

### Documentation & Communication

- Write about your achievements
- Share knowledge through blog posts
- Present at team meetings
- Communicate asynchronously

Note:
Your work means nothing if nobody knows about it. Document your achievements, write about your learnings, and share knowledge. This isn't about bragging - it's about professional visibility. Present at team meetings, write internal blog posts, communicate asynchronously so there's a record of your contributions.

---

## Ask and Give Back

### The Feedback Loop

- Ask feedback from people you respect
- Not all feedback is useful - filter wisely
- Seek peer feedback (especially from non-engineers)
- Find external validation through community

---

## Mentor Others

### Give Back to the Community

- Teaching solidifies your own knowledge
- Builds your reputation
- Creates valuable connections
- Helps you see problems from different perspectives

---

## Own Your Career

### You Care Most About Your Success

- Managers can change
- Companies can restructure
- Your career is your responsibility
- Invest in continuous learning

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Understand the rules** - Know what your company values
2. **"I'm on it"** - Take accountability and make work visible
3. **Ask and give back** - Build relationships and help others

Note:
Let me summarize the three key rules: First, understand what your company actually rewards through concrete examples. Second, develop the "I'm on it" mentality and make your work visible. Third, actively seek feedback and give back to others - this builds a strong professional network.
