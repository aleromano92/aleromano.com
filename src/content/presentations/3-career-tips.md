# 3 Career Tips Nobody Talks About
### For Software Engineers

Note:
Welcome! Today I'll share three career tips that most engineers never hear about. These insights come from 13+ years in tech and watching what actually gets people promoted.

---

## The Wrong Approach ❌

> "I want to grow as an Individual Contributor, so I decided to study C++ to aim for a promotion"

Note:
I told exactly this to my manager when I was a Junior 25 years old engineer.

# The 3 Tips 🎯

1. Understand what your company rewards 🏆 <!-- .element: class="" -->
2. "I'm on it" mentality 💪 <!-- .element: class="blur" -->
3. Ask for feedback and give back 🤝 <!-- .element: class="blur" -->

Note:
Here are the three tips that actually drive promotions. Let's start with tip number one.

---

## Companies Are Different

- Google: Launch new products <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Amazon: Improve existing processes <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Some companies: Just save cloud costs <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
Google rewards launching new products - hence the Google graveyard. Amazon focuses on efficiency. Others just want you to optimize their AWS bill.

---

## Career Frameworks Are Just Starting Points

- Often too generic <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Words like "complexity" and "high impact" <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Ask your manager for concrete examples <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
Don't rely on the career framework document. Ask your manager to translate those vague principles into real examples.

---

## Business Impact 📊

- "I improved performance" ❌ <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- "I reduced response times by 40%, saving €X per year" ✅  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- "I increased system resilience" ❌ <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- "Incidents decreased from 4/month to 1/quarter" ✅ <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

### Quantify Everything 🔢<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
Business impact is universal. But you must quantify it. Numbers make your achievements concrete and memorable.

---

## Glue Work Matters Too 🔗

- Mentorship 🧑‍🏫 <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Unblocking colleagues 🚧➡️ <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Cross-team solutions 🤝 <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Facilitating communication 💬 <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
Ask audience if they know about Glue work. It is essential but hard to measure. Make it visible.

---

## Help Your Manager Succeed 🎯

- <span class="fragment">Their objectives = your opportunities 🚪</span>
- <span class="fragment">Ask: "What are *your* main goals this quarter?"❓</span>
- <span class="fragment">Actively contribute to their targets 🏹</span>
- <span class="fragment">Build trust by making their job easier 🤝</span>

Note:
Ask the audience: "have you ever asked your manager about how THEY are going to be evaluated?" 
Your manager's success directly impacts yours. Understand their goals and actively help them achieve those goals.

# The 3 Tips 🎯

1. Understand what your company rewards 🏆 <!-- .element: class="blur" -->
2. "I'm on it" mentality 💪 <!-- .element: class="" -->
3. Ask for feedback and give back 🤝 <!-- .element: class="blur" -->

Note:
Now let's dive into tip number two - the "I'm on it" mentality.

---

## The Power of "I'm On It"

> Have you seen a senior engineer respond "I'm on it" to an incident?

- Builds reputation for reliability <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Demonstrates proactivity <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Creates serenity and admiration <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Makes people want to help you <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
When someone says "I'm on it" during an incident, everyone feels relief. That person becomes indispensable. The boundary with a Hero Culture is subtle, be aware.

---

## Always Keep Your Promises 🤝

- When you can't deliver, communicate proactively 📢 <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Transparency builds trust ✨ <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Silence destroys it 🔇 <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- "This is complex, let me think and get back to you by Friday" ⏰ <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
Never let someone discover you're late by asking you. Communicate delays as soon as you know about them.

---

## Make Your Work Visible 👀

- Documentation 📚 <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Presentations 📽️ <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Async communication 💬 <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- 1-on-1s 🗣️ <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->


Note:
The best work is useless if nobody knows about it. Make your contributions visible through multiple channels.
Documentation - Decision records, post-mortems, brag journal  
Presentations - Share project results in team meetings 
Async communication - Update on progress regularly
1-on-1s - Don't assume your manager knows everything

# The 3 Tips 🎯

1. Understand what your company rewards 🏆 <!-- .element: class="blur" -->
2. "I'm on it" mentality 💪 <!-- .element: class="blur" -->
3. Ask for feedback and give back 🤝 <!-- .element: class="" -->

Note:
Finally, let's explore tip number three - asking for feedback and giving back.

---

## Filter Feedback Wisely

- Ask people you respect 👥 <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Who have achieved results you admire 🌟 <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Don't limit yourself to engineers 🌈 <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Thank them and explain your action plan 🙏 <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
Be selective about whose feedback you seek. And remember, giving feedback requires investment from others.
A PM teaching you storytelling is as valuable as a senior engineer suggesting JVM internals. Different perspectives reveal blind spots.

---

## Be a Mentor 🧑‍🏫

- Teaching solidifies your knowledge 🧠 <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Builds your reputation 📈 <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Creates valuable connections 🤝 <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Think of your first mentor - be that for someone else 💭 <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
Few things accelerate your growth like helping others grow. Think about who turned the corner for you in your career.

---

## External Validation 🌟

- Meetups and conferences 🎤 <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Open source contributions 🔓 <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Technical writing ✍️ <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Builds internal credibility 💎 <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
External recognition gives you internal credibility and creates a portfolio of your skills.

## One Last Thing ☝️

Learning new languages **can** be the right move...

<span class="fragment">But if you think it is the <b>only</b> thing needed.</span>

<span class="fragment"><b>It's not.</b></span>

Note:
Don't misunderstand me - technical skills matter. But they're just one piece of the puzzle, not the whole solution.
