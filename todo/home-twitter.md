in the index.astro i would like to render the last 3-5 twitter posts I've created. if possible, include reposts too. while my website is static generated, this component should check about new posts every 5 minutes.

i want to let people know that i use twitter for my random thoughts, from my passion about videogames, tennis and football to political satire. i want to say that i don't take myself seriously in general, but in particular when i use twitter. i want to say i try to include in my bubble users with an opposite view of the world compared to mine and i sometimes end up liking some of their posts
