in the index.astro i would like to render the last 3-5 twitter posts I've created, liked or re-twitted (re-posted).
 
while my website is statically generated, this component should render live on the page at each refresh, so we will probably need to use some client-side javascript. 
If this is not possible, since I'm using SSR, we can even make index.astro a dynamic rendered page.

i want to let people know that i use twitter for my random thoughts, from my passion about videogames, tennis and football to political satire. i want to say that i don't take myself seriously in general, but in particular when i use twitter. i want to say i try to include in my bubble users with an opposite view of the world compared to mine and i sometimes end up liking some of their posts.
This should come as a little disclaimer before showing the posts.

I want a small LIVE label with white font and red background to indicate that these posts are being fetched live. Use rounded borders for it, like camera's logo when recording.
