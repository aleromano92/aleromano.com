I don't want to use  Google Analytics on my website nor other third-party services that track users. Reason being: it's in the philosopy of this website to DIY for the most part, and not outsource user tracking to third parties.
Plus, this is a quite interesting engineering topic that will teach me a lot as we need to think of collecting events, storing them and then visualize them.

I would love to understand if we can build something that do not require cookies or at least do not require a cookie policy and a stupid cookie banner (i have already one which is a political take on the cookie banners being useless and harmful).
