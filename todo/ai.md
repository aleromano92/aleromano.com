TL;DR: if you have many interruptions + you don't code everyday, AI can make coding joyful again

CONTEXT: EM of 3 teams, so almost 0 coding at work except for, well, exceptions + father of 2 kids

I'm revamping my personal website which is currently using Super.so over my Notion account. I'm migrating to Astro deployed as a Docker image on a Hetzner VPS. Main reason: stay close to the tech, learn something new, share something for future me.

HOW'S GOING: before I started using Cursor I was struggling a lot progressing on this revamp. I just code during evening / week-ends, but I may have 2-3 block of 30 minutes with lot of interruptions (far from ideal for a maker schedule).

With Cursor I found joy again:
I do not believe my thinking is getting less sharp, as I invest time on writing prompts. The feeling I',m getting is I'm writing English instead of Typescript. But I'm still owning the Design of the software
I do not get stuck because I'm rugged with the syntax. For example, I know I can augment typescript types with .d.ts files or I can create responsive design with CSS gap and clamp and rem , but I'm not doing these things every day so I couldn't remember exact syntax. using Cursor it is relieving me from this burden
context is everything. It is true for Humans and AIs, so I'm forced to communicate all the relevant pieces of context If I want an high quality job as output
