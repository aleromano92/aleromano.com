## Feature: Implement SQLite Integration for Data Caching

### 1. Feature Overview
**Problem Statement**: The website currently stores Twitter API responses in JavaScript variables in memory, which are lost every time the Docker container restarts during deployment, leading to unnecessary API calls and potential performance issues.

**User Goal**: Implement SQLite as a persistent caching layer to store Twitter API responses and other data, ensuring data survives container restarts and deployments.

**Business Value**: Improves website performance by reducing redundant API calls, enhances reliability during deployments, and provides a foundation for future data storage needs like analytics.

### 2. User Story
**As a** website developer and owner  
**I want** to cache Twitter API responses in a SQLite database  
**So that** the data persists across Docker container restarts and deployments, reducing API load and improving user experience

### 3. Technical Context
**Affected Systems**: Twitter API integration, Docker container lifecycle, server-side rendering (SSR) with Node.js adapter  
**Integration Points**: twitter utilities, Docker deployment workflow, existing caching mechanisms  
**Constraints**: Must be built from scratch without external SaaS services; should integrate with existing Astro/Node.js stack; maintain performance in serverless-like environment  
**Architecture Dependencies**: Leverage existing utils patterns, Docker multi-stage builds, and TypeScript strict typing

### 4. Acceptance Criteria
**Core Functionality**:
- [ ] SQLite database initialized on container startup
- [ ] Twitter API responses cached with configurable TTL
- [ ] Cache hit/miss logic implemented in Twitter utilities
- [ ] Data persists across container restarts

**Technical Requirements**:
- [ ] TypeScript strict typing for database operations
- [ ] Proper error handling for database connections
- [ ] Migration scripts for database schema changes
- [ ] Performance monitoring for cache operations

**Quality Gates**:
- [ ] Unit tests for caching logic
- [ ] Integration tests for database operations
- [ ] Error handling tested for database failures
- [ ] Performance benchmarks for cache operations

### 5. Implementation Approach
**Preferred Method**: Incremental development with separate phases for setup, basic caching, and advanced features  
**Phase Breakdown**: 
1. SQLite setup and basic database utilities
2. Twitter API caching integration
3. Schema migrations and error handling
4. Performance optimization and monitoring  
**Validation Points**: Pause after each phase for testing and approval  
**Technical Design**: Use `better-sqlite3` for Node.js SQLite operations; create database utilities in `src/utils/database.ts`; integrate with existing Twitter fetch logic

### 6. Testing Strategy
**Business Logic**: Test cache hit/miss scenarios, TTL expiration, and data persistence across simulated restarts  
**Integration Points**: Validate Twitter API integration with caching; test Docker container lifecycle with database  
**Manual Testing**: Deploy to staging environment and verify cache persistence across restarts; monitor API call reduction

### 7. Examples & References
**Similar Features**: Look at existing twitter.ts for API caching patterns  
**External Inspiration**: SQLite documentation for Node.js; examples from Astro/Node.js projects using SQLite for caching  
**Design Mockups**: N/A - this is backend infrastructure

### 8. Change Impact Assessment
**Files to Modify**: 
- New: `src/utils/database.ts`
- Modified: twitter files, Dockerfile, docker-compose both dev and prod, package.json
- New: Database migration scripts in scripts  
**Breaking Changes**: None expected - caching is additive  
**Documentation Updates**: Update README.md with SQLite setup; document caching behavior

### 9. Questions for Clarification
**Technical Decisions**: Which SQLite wrapper library to use (`better-sqlite3` vs `sqlite3`)? How to handle database file location in Docker?  
**Scope Boundaries**: Focus on Twitter caching first; analytics storage as future enhancement  
**Future Considerations**: How might this integrate with potential analytics features or other data storage needs?
