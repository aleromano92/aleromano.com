I've read great things about SQLite and I would like to start exploring this tecdhnology.

An initial simple use case would be to store some data from my contact form (hosted on the same VPS as my website) together with the current feature of of sending them via email.

In the future I can plan more use cases, like storing some analytics data or other things.
