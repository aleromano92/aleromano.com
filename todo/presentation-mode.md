i don't want to use google slides or power point anymore. at the same time i want to apply for many more request for speakers at different conferences as i feel quite energised by being on stage telling many people about my experiences.

some of my blog posts can be easily presented as talk and I've actually a concrete case with the 3-career-tips post.

i want you to build a feature that when rendering a blog post, if its presentable mode is present, put a button on the blogpostlayout after the Tags. when clicked, it enters presentation mode where slides-like stuff can be navigated the way you usually do when speaking at a conference.

this presentation mode should be something like slides.com and be embedded in my website. let's research on the web if we can reuse an already made library or we should go and buid this feature from scratch.
slides content should be initially created based on the blog post but then stored as a markdown file committed in the repo.
if a linked markdown of this lind exists, the button i mentioned before should be rendered in the blog post layout.
