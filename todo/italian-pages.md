Currently all the static content like blog posts are present in both italian and englis within the src/content/blog folder.

I have the ambition to translate in italian all the other pages present at src/pages, I currently have only the /it/blog.astro page translated.

I'm not sure what would be the best way to approach this translation process. Should i duplicate the page and amend the texts? but what If i need to modify something, I need to remember to do it twice in 2 places?

There must be a more efficient way to manage translations.

As usual, the philosophy of this website is try to build from scratch and keep it simple so I would prefer avoiding using any SaaS solutions or a complicated one.
