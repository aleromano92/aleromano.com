i want a big popup appearing from the bottom of the index.astro page occupying 50vh with a big title that says: this is not a cookie banner.
It should not appear on any /blog or /posts page.

inside it there should be a paragraph explaining how i think cookies banner are a perfect example of a bad implementation of a good in theory principle. explain how it created an anti pattern in user behaviour (immediately clicking and dismissing banner without reading) and how EU bureaucracy is hindering the power pf investments of EU companies.

explain how my website does not use any form of analytics at the current moment and if it will in the future it will probably be a self hosted version (custom made or open source products) without targeting data.

State that I support intiiative like eu/acc [website](https://eu-acc.com/) and AVE europe https://ave-europa.eu/ to spread the word and sponsor them.

this banner should appear only on home page and once closed it should store this info on localStorage never to appear again. Still put a link in the footer that once clicked will allow the banner to be shown again.
