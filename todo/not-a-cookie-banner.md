i want a big popup appearing from the bottom of the page occupying 50vh with a big title that says: this is not a cookie banner.

inside it there should be a paragraph explaining how i think cookies banner are a perfect example of a bad implementation of a good in theory principle. explain how it created an anti pattern in user behaviour and how EU bureaucracy is hindering the power pf investments of EU companies.

explain how my website does not use any form of analytics at the current moment and if it will in the future it will probably be a self hosted version (custom made or open source products) without targeting data.

link to the eu/acc website to spread the word and sponsor them.

this banner should appear only on home page and once closed it should store on localStorage never to appear again.
