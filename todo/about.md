The About page need to be revamped as it currenlty very similar to the Home page.

The idea is to provide more detailed information about my previous work experiences. There could be even a download button for my CV.

I want to have a NOW section within this page to express what i'm currently doing, studying, playing etc etc A section for which i put a recurrent task in my calendar to update every 3 months.
Ideally, this NOW section can have collapsible sections for storing what I was doing previously.

Let's keep the twitter feed section.

We can think of implementing the @Person tag for this page and that would be a starting point for structured markup.
