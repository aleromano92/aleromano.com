I want to create a contact form that will use exposed API to send me an email.

in this way, my email won't be public on the site.

i want to define contact reasons:
- errors on the website -> will just create a github issue
- consultancy request (including mentoring) -> will send me an email
- job opportunities -> will ask clarification questions about which kind of role and only if everything meets my skills will allow to send the offer
- general inquiry -> will send me an email
