My website is quite simple and mainly static, but i have some APIs (in the contact page) and although i've setup simple observability that checks erro logs and send alert to my telegram bot, I would like to take this opportunity to explore and learn more about open source observability tools.

I think a setup that leverage the "graphana stack" would be a good fit for my use case, but I'm open to suggestions.

My ultimate goal is to have an observability dashboard that summarize the status of my system and of the services exposed (like the API). This dashboard should not be accessible on the internet, but only on my VPS private network, so advise me on how to proceed here too.

It should access access logs from Nginx too i think, but i'm open to suggestions.
