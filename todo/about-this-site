I want to create a blog post about this website to explain

1. why i decided to host on a VPS (I felt i was unlearning the basic of internet due to super DX of vercel/netlify)
2. I want to stay hands-on on something similar
3. as a father of 2 and EM of 3 teams i don't have much time for coding nor long focus block (not even during the week-end). So i wanted to leverage an AI-assisted developer worflow with Cursor (and create a dedicated post about my experience)
4. I didn't want to spend 16 usd for Super.so
